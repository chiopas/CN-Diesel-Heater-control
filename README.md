# CN-Diesel-Heater-control

1. Connect two relays signal pins to D11 and D7 of arduino NANO pins and Temperature sensor to D2. 
2. Take apart the controller and solder two wires at each end of the on and off buttons (four wires in total)
3. Insert two wires coming from ON button from relay which is connected to Arduino pin D11 to relay NC and COM contacts.
4. Insert two wires coming from OFF button from relay which is connected to Arduino pin D7 to relay NC and COM contacts.
5. Upload code to the Arduino Nano. 

Use serial monitor for debuging if needed.
