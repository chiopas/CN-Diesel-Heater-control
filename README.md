# CN-Diesel-Heater-control

1. Solder Temperature sensor to D2 of Arduino together with 3.3V and GND.  
2. Take apart the controller and solder two wires at each end of the on/off button and connect it to relay NC and COM contacts.
3. Solder LCD wires to arduino nano accordingly:
    rs = 12, 
    en = 11,
    d4 = 5,
    d5 = 4,
    d6 = 3,
    d7 = 2;
4. Upload source code to the Arduino Nano (Modify temperatures if you need to).
5. Enjoy :)
